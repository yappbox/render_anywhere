render_anywhere
====================

Out of the box, Rails can render templates in a controller context only. This little gem allows for calling "render" from anywhere: models, background jobs, rake tasks, you name it.

Installation
------------------

    gem install render_anywhere

Usage
--------------------

Put render_anywhere in your Gemfile: 

    gem 'render_anywhere', :require => false

In your Rails app, in a rake task, model, background job, or where ever you like, require render_anywhere, include the module and call render with the same arguments as ActionController::Base#render takes. It will return a string.

    require 'render_anywhere'

    class AnyClass
      include RenderAnywhere

      def build_html
        html = render :template => 'normal/template/reference',
                      :layout => 'application'
        html
      end
    end
